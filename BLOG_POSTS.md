# How to Choose Clay Tiles for Your Project: Architect's Guide

## Understanding Clay Tile Specifications

### 1. Water Absorption Rate
- Class I: <3% (vitreous)
- Class II: 3-6% (semi-vitreous)
- Class III: 6-10% (semi-porous)
- Class IV: >10% (porous)

**For Indian Climate:**
- Exteriors: Class II or III
- Interiors: Class III or IV acceptable
- Flooring: Class II recommended

### 2. Compressive Strength
- Minimum for load-bearing: 75 kg/cm²
- Minimum for cladding: 35 kg/cm²
- Premium tiles: 100+ kg/cm²

### 3. Efflorescence Rating
- Low efflorescence: <10% coverage
- Moderate: 10-50% coverage
- High: >50% coverage

**Always choose low-efflorescence tiles for Indian conditions**

## Quality Checks Before Buying

### Visual Inspection
1. **Color Consistency:** Variations acceptable for handmade
2. **Surface Finish:** No cracks, chips, or deformities
3. **Size Tolerance:** ±2mm acceptable
4. **Edge Quality:** Sharp, clean edges

### Physical Tests
1. **Ring Test:** Tap tile - should produce clear ring
2. **Water Drop Test:** Drop should bead up (if sealed)
3. **Scratch Test:** Shouldn't scratch easily
4. **Dimensional Check:** Measure multiple tiles

## Calculating Quantity

### Formula:
```
Area (sq ft) = Length × Height
Tiles Needed = Area ÷ Tile Coverage
Add 10% wastage
Add 5% extra for future repairs
```

### Example:
- Wall: 20ft × 10ft = 200 sq ft
- Tile size: 230mm × 105mm = 0.25 sq ft
- Tiles needed: 200 ÷ 0.25 = 800 pieces
- With wastage: 800 × 1.15 = 920 pieces

## Pricing Negotiation Tips

1. **Bulk Orders:** 10-15% discount on 1000+ sq ft
2. **Direct from Manufacturer:** Save 20-30%
3. **Off-Season:** Better prices in monsoon
4. **Payment Terms:** Negotiate for project-based payments

## Installation Specifications

### Substrate Preparation
- Surface must be clean, dry, level
- Prime with bonding agent
- Check for moisture content (<5%)

### Adhesive Selection
- Polymer-modified thin-set mortar
- Coverage: 3-4 kg per sq meter
- Pot life: 2-3 hours

### Joint Width
- Floor tiles: 3-5mm
- Wall tiles: 2-3mm
- Expansion joints: Every 3-4 meters

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. ❌ Not checking water absorption
2. ❌ Skipping sample testing
3. ❌ Buying from single batch
4. ❌ Ignoring efflorescence rating
5. ❌ Not planning for wastage
6. ❌ Choosing wrong adhesive
7. ❌ Skipping sealing step

## Sustainability Considerations

- ✓ Local sourcing (reduce transport emissions)
