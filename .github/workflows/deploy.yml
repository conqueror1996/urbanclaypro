          # Deploy the standalone output if using standalone, OR just the project files
          # For Node.js hosting on Hostinger, it's often easiest to just upload the build artifacts
          # However, cleaning the remote directory can be dangerous if not careful.
          # Let's try to sync the necessary folders.
          # Using standalone mode requires special handling.
          # Simpler for now: Sync everything except node_modules, then install on server?
          # Best for automation: Build here, upload .next, public, package.json
