# Journal / Thought Leadership Redesign Strategy

## 1. Above-the-fold Improvements

### Headline Options
*Goal: Short, authoritative, architectural tone.*
1.  **"Material & Context"** (Focuses on the core product value)
2.  **"The Architect's Ledger"** (Implies serious, professional reading)
3.  **"Built Narratives"** (Story-focused)
*Recommendation:* **"Material & Context"** — it signals that this isn't just about "tiles", but about how they fit into the larger architectural ecosystem.

### Subheading Options
*Goal: Clearly define value for architects.*
1.  "A curated dialogue on sustainable masonry, facade engineering, and the future of Indian architecture."
2.  "Technical insights and design narratives for the modern builder. Exploring the potential of terracotta."
3.  "Where traditional craft meets different climatic needs. A resource for architects building for the future."
*Recommendation:* **"A curated dialogue on sustainable masonry, facade engineering, and the future of Indian architecture."**

### Featured Story Layout
-   **Layout**: 60:40 Split (Image:Text).
-   **Image**: Aspect ratio 3:2 or 16:9. Cinematic, high contrast.
-   **Typography**: Huge Serif headline (4rem+), readable Sans-serif body.
-   **Metadata**: Category (Caps, tracking wide) | Read Time | Author.

## 2. Journal Listing Structure

### Grid vs Column Logic
-   **Recommendation**: **Masonry-style Grid (3-column)** or **Asymmetric Grid**.
-   **Why**: A standard 3-column grid feels like a generic blog. An asymmetric grid (some cards wide, some tall) feels like a *magazine* layout.
-   **Differentiation**:
    -   *Featured*: Full width or two-thirds width. Large image.
    -   *Technical*: Clean, structured, maybe schematic thumbnail or detail shot. Tagged "Technical Note".
    -   *Inspirational*: Full bleed image card. Tagged "Case Study".

### Card Metadata
1.  **Category** (e.g., "FACADE SYSTEMS")
2.  **Read Time** (e.g., "4 MIN READ")
3.  **Context** (e.g., "TROPICAL CLIMATE") *-- Crucial for architects.*

## 3. Content Taxonomy & Filters

### Better Category Names
*Generic: Architecture, Sustainability, Design, Product Guide*
**Refined:**
1.  **Facade Engineering** (Technical focus)
2.  **Design Narratives** (Case studies/Inspiration)
3.  **Sustainable Practice** (Green building, climate responsiveness)
4.  **Material Innovation** (Product deep dives, R&D)

### Suggested Filters
1.  **Building Type**: Residential, Commercial, Institutional.
2.  **Application**: Facade, Interior, Landscaping.
3.  **Climate Zone**: Tropical, Arid, Temperate (Very useful for Indian context).

## 4. Editorial Tone & Writing Guidance

### Writing Rules
1.  **No Fluff**: Avoid adjectives like "stunning", "amazing". Use precise terms: "textural", "thermally efficient", "monolithic".
2.  **Problem-Solution**: Every article should address an architectural problem (heat gain, privacy, longevity).
3.  **Passive Voice is okay** if it emphasizes the object/building over the writer.

### Example Article Intro
*"In the dense urban fabric of Mumbai, the 'breathing wall' is not an aesthetic choice but a climatic necessity. The recent cantilevered brick residence by [Architect Name] demonstrates how traditional terracotta jalis can reduce internal thermal gain by up to 4°C, significantly lowering reliance on HVAC systems while maintaining visual privacy."*

### Conversion Strategy
-   **Subtle CTAs**: "Download Technical Spec" (Button) or "Request Material Sample" (Link text).
-   **Placement**: End of article, or a sleek mid-article breakout box (not a popup).

## 5. Visual & UI Refinements

### Typography Hierarchy
-   **Display**: Serif (e.g., Playfair Display or similar used in project) - Large, distinct.
-   **UI Text**: Sans-serif (Inter/Geist) - Small, uppercase, widely tracked.
-   **Body**: a high-readability Serif or Sans-serif, strictly greyscale (zinc-700).

### Visual Principles
-   **Architectural Calm**: High whitespace. No borders on cards, just spacing.
-   **Images**: No drop shadows. Sharp edges (radius-none or radius-sm).
-   **Interactions**: Slow, ease-out hovers. No bouncy animations.

*Implementation Note: I will now apply the "Architectural Calm" layout and the new Taxonomy to the Journal page components.*
