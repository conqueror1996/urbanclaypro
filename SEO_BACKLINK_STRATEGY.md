# Backlink Strategy for Urban Clay

Backlinks (other websites linking to yours) are crucial for SEO authority. Since Urban Clay is a premium architectural brand, quality matters more than quantity.

## 1. Digital PR & Architecture Platforms (High Impact)
Submit your best projects (like "Bhairavi Residence") to architectural showcases. These sites have massive domain authority.
*   **ArchDaily**: Submit via their "Submit a Project" page.
*   **Dezeen**: Similar submission process.
*   **Architecture Digest (AD India)**: Reach out to editors with high-res photos.
*   **The Architects Diary**: Very popular in India.
*   **Buildofy**: Video features often link back.

## 2. Supplier & Partner Links (Low Hanging Fruit)
Ask the people you work with to link to you.
*   **Architects**: "We are the terracotta supplier for [Firm Name]." Ask them to credit "Urban Clay" with a link on their project page.
*   **Contractors/Builders**: If they have a "Partners" page.
*   **Dealers**: If you have authorized dealers, ensure they link to your official site.

## 3. The "Clay Journal" Strategy (Content Marketing)
People link to useful content, not product pages. Use your Journal for this.
*   **Technical Guides**: Write "The Ultimate Guide to Preventing Algae on Facades". Other blogs will link to this as a reference.
*   **Tremd Reports**: "Indian Facade Trends 2025".
*   **Infographics**: Create a visual chart of "Wirecut vs. Handmade Bricks" and allow others to embed it if they credit you.

## 4. Local Certifications & Directories
*   **Google Business Profile**: Ensure your website button works.
*   **Justdial / IndiaMART**: While not "premium", they provide foundational local signals.
*   **Green Building Councils**: If you have eco-certifications (IGBC, GRIHA), their member directories often provide high-quality links.

## 5. Social Distibution (Signals)
While social links (Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn) are usually "Nofollow" (don't pass direct SEO juice), they drive traffic which *leads* to organic backlinks.
*   **Pinterest**: Create boards for "Terracotta Facades" linking to your product pages.
*   **LinkedIn**: Publish articles about the manufacturing process.

## Action Plan
1.  **Identify Top 5 Projects**: Gather high-res photos and write technical descriptions.
2.  **Submit to One Platform/Week**: Start with *The Architects Diary* or *ArchDaily*.
3.  **Email Architects**: "Hi [Name], we loved working on [Project]. Could you update the vendor list on your website to link to us?"
